## Interactive WebAssembly

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the use cases for Blazor.Auth in a Blazor application that is currently using `Interactive WebAssembly` render mode:

### Get AuthenticationState

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant component as Component

box rgba(101, 63, 232, 0.5) Blazor.Auth
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant blazorServer as Blazor Server
end

user ->>+ component: User request
component ->>+ userServiceClient: GetAuthenticationStateAsync()

note over component,userServiceClient: The specifics of request flow <br /> via Blazor internal tooling are <br /> omitted for the sake of brevity.

userServiceClient ->>+ blazorServer: HTTP request to <br /> "_auth/me" endpoint

blazorServer -->> blazorServer: Acquire AuthenticationState <br /> using access token cookie
blazorServer -->> userServiceClient: AuthenticationState

userServiceClient -->>- component: AuthenticationState

component -->>- user: #32;
```

### Sign-In

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as Page

box rgba(101, 63, 232, 0.5) Blazor.Auth
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as Blazor Server
end

participant authService as IAuthenticationService (Server)

user ->>+ page: Submit Sign-In Form
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignInAsync(signInPayload)
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService <br/> from your DI container<br/> and call it's `SignInAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-In endpoint

userServiceServer ->>+ authService: SignInAsync(signInPayload)
authService ->> authService: Your server-side sign-in logic

authService -->>- userServiceServer: AuthenticationResult
userServiceServer -->> userServiceServer: Update authentication cookies
userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: AuthenticationOperationInfo

note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Updated cookies will be<br/>attached to the HTTP response.

userServiceClient -->>- page: AuthenticationOperationInfo
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon receiving AuthenticationOperationInfo from IUserService, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).
```

### Sign-Out

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as Page

box rgba(101, 63, 232, 0.5) Blazor.Auth
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as Blazor Server
end

user ->>+ page: Initiate Sign-Out
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignOutAsync()
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService <br/> from your DI container<br/> and call it's `SignOutAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-Out endpoint

userServiceServer -->> userServiceServer: Clear authentication cookies
userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: #32;

note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Blazor.Auth will clear the user's <br/> authentication cookies <br/> by marking them as expired <br/> in the HTTP response.

userServiceClient -->>- page: #32;
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon finishing method execution, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).
```

### Sign-Up

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as Page

box rgba(101, 63, 232, 0.5) Blazor.Auth
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as Blazor Server
end

participant authService as IAuthenticationService (Server)

user ->>+ page: Submit Sign-Up Form
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignUpAsync(signUpPayload)
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService <br/> from your DI container<br/> and call it's `SignInAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-Up endpoint

userServiceServer ->>+ authService: SignUpAsync(signUpPayload)
authService ->> authService: Your server-side sign-up logic

authService -->>- userServiceServer: AuthenticationResult
userServiceServer -->> userServiceServer: Update authentication cookies
userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: AuthenticationOperationInfo

note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Updated cookies will be<br/>attached to the HTTP response.

userServiceClient -->>- page: AuthenticationOperationInfo
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon receiving AuthenticationOperationInfo from IUserService, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).
